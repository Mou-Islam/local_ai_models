The Roman Empire was one of the most influential civilizations in world history. It began in the city of Rome in the 8th century BC and grew into a vast empire that stretched from Britain to Egypt and from Spain to Mesopotamia. The Romans were known for their military prowess, engineering marvels like aqueducts and roads, and their system of law, which has influenced legal systems worldwide. The empire's official language was Latin, which is the ancestor of modern Romance languages such as French, Spanish, and Italian. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD is traditionally considered the end of ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages. However, its legacy in art, architecture, language, law, and religion continues to shape the modern world.
